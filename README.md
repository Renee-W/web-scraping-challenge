# Mission to Mars

For the Mission to Mars work, I ceated a new repository to store this project and began by visting the NASA site (https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) to determine what information I would be looking at.  I created a Jupyter Notebook to begin my scraping challenge. To my notebook I imported Pandas and BeautifulSoup, later I added splinter to my import request.  I pulled the news title and paragraph text from the site.  After pulling headlines, I examined the feature image that corrisponded to this headline.  

I was also interested in facts about Mars.  I visited the webpage (https://space-facts.com/mars/) for facts and converted that to a string.  I visited the USGS site (https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) for high resolution images to include.  Utilizing MongoDB and Fask I created a new HTML page to display the information that was scraped.
